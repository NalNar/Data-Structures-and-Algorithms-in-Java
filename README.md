# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Java
A structured and documented journey through Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java — Goodrich Implementation

This repository documents my full journey through **Goodrich, Tamassia & Goldwasser — Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (6th/7th Edition)**.

It includes:
- Chapter-wise Java implementations  
- Fully worked exercises  
- Notes, intuition, and complexity analysis  
- Visualizations & explanations  

My goal is to deeply master DSA for interviews, coursework, and the NYU CS placement exam.
